Vim in action - Why vim can be a great IDE or your text editor of choice. Tips, tricks and examples shown during live demo.
 
I will focus on the following aspects:
- VIM basic text editing and navigation in a fast way
- Using macros, regexes, functions from linux
- Using it as an IDE in a larger project (giza showcase)

1. Why my vim looks pretty and can be useful?

  .vimrc

2. Why use vim:

  1# Can be used without graphical interface (useful with ssl)
  2# Is on every linux
  3# You can do things really fast (will show some demo later)
  4# Is really light do not charge your VM / environment

3. VIM basics:

    :line_number - go to line

    i - marking inside
    t - till

    zz - leave and save  - :wq
    zq - leave don't save :q!

    f sign - find sign
    / - search down

4. Examples

  1. Macro (what is that?)
    -Macro for swaping words with numbers and adding something at the and of each line

    -Numerize from 15-30 # put =range(15,30)
  3. Inside / tile
  4. Useful regex
    %s/\d\+/\=(submatch(0)+1)/g  # increase numbers
    %s/\s\+$//e # remove white signs
    %s/mleko/kakao/g 
  5. Functions from linux
    -date # .! date
    -ls # .! ls

    -ctags (ctrl + [, ctrl + t )
    -gf
